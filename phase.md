## üìù Reflection on IaC & Manual Deployment Challenges

### What I Learned:
- I now understand how to write Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform** to provision real cloud resources.
- I learned how to build and push Docker images to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- I experienced deploying applications to **Azure Container Apps** manually through the portal.

### Challenges I Faced:
- I accidentally committed a **CosmosDB connection string**, which triggered GitHub‚Äôs push protection. I learned how important secret management is.
- Figuring out the right order for provisioning (Resource Group ‚Üí ACR ‚Üí CosmosDB ‚Üí Container App) took time.
- Setting up container permissions to pull from ACR required attention to **role assignments**.

### How I Overcame Them:
- I fixed secret leaks by rewriting history and cleaning commits.
- I read **Azure‚Äôs documentation** carefully to understand each resource dependency.
- I verified deployments manually through the Azure Portal after pushing my images.
